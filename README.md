## UVic Special Collections and University Archives Wikidata Project
### Visualization Experimentation

**July, 2020**
_Project by Elizabeth Bassett, Special Collections and Archives Assistant (YCW)_

The goal of this project is to experiment with ways that UVic Libraries can utilize Wikidata to promote interest in the holdings at Special Collections and University Archives (SCUA). The following visualizations use SPARQL queries to compile information about people and institutions who have archives and correspondence held at UVIC SCUA. As more instances of the "archives at" property are used to connect SCUA with people and institutions with pages on Wikidata, the visualizations will become more representative of the Archives' holdings.
